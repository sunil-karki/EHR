*Work-Related Learning on Electronic Healthcare Records*

## About EHR (Electronic health records) / Electronic medical records (EMR)
An EHR is a computerized collection of a patient's health records. EHRs include information like your age, gender, ethnicity, health history, medicines, allergies, immunization status, lab test results, hospital discharge instructions, and billing information.

Help patients as well as health professionals. Makes it easier for you (and your parents, depending on your age) to see your health records.
Helps patients take part in his/her own health care. Eg. can view test results, keep track of things like glucose if you have diabetes, review your medical team's instructions, and even check for errors.
Your healthcare providers can share these digital health records if they're in the same hospital, clinic, or healthcare system. So, for example, if you go to a dermatologist, an asthma specialist, and your primary care doctor, all these doctors see identical records.

If one doctor orders a lab test, they all see the results. If one doctor puts you on a new medicine, the others get to see what it is. So there's less chance of one health care provider prescribing a medication that could cause problems if it's used with another medicine.

**_Note:_** Part of HIPAA called the Security Rule protects the storage and transfer of EHRs.

## About Source Data
*Source data*:- [Synthetic Patient Generation Realistic Health Data Link](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/): <ins>*https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/*</ins>

The source data is from SyntheaTM, an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. It provides high-quality, synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions, enabling research with Health IT data that is otherwise legally or practically unavailable.

## About Work-Related Learning
This is academic work done as per the prerequisite of the course module 'Work Related Learning' performed in Cotiviti. This work is to perform data analysis and visualization of the data set(i.e Source Data mentioned).
